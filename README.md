## Welcome to GregTech Community Edition
### What is this?
GregTech Community Edition or shortly **GTCE** is Minecraft mod. And this repository shelters all code and associated files.

### GregTech?
Yes, you probably already heard this name before as it is quite known one in modding community. This is **indirect descendant** and **total rewrite** of _**the GregTech**_ also it is **not created or maintained by GregoriusT**.

If you did not hear about it yet let me shortly describe what this mod it is all about. It is about **Technology**. Wait was it to short? Hm, let me try again.

This mod is about **technology** and **progression**.
From simple crude tools which will allow you to process resources more realistically.
Through **Steam Age** where first machines will help you save some precious resources and open new possibilities.
To many **Electric Ages** where machines will become indispensable helpers. Rows and rows of them will be working on processing complex resources creating even more complex materials to be used in machines of higher tiers.
And let's not forget about multiblock machines working on lengthy processing chains.
Also, there is whole power generation system from simple wood burning for steam to plasma powered turbines.

### Community Edition?
**Community Edition** is necessary part of **GTCE name** as it defines what will this project give to world also it is required by permission to use GregTech name.

It could be said that this is simple case of community driven development.
Of course, it does not mean that anyone can get in whatever they want.
This is about listening to community and taking suggestion to account when working on any stuff.

### Project Idea
To bring GregTech to modern version of Minecraft (or at least at that time was 1.12 modern version). And created possible the best edition ever.
For that reason Gregtech 5 Unofficial was used as base and some ideas from GT4 and GT6 were thrown in. Also some community suggestions were applied.
